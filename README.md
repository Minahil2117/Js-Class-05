# 📚 JavaScript Class 5 - DOM Manipulation Tasks

## 👋 Welcome!

This repository contains two DOM manipulation tasks completed as part of **JavaScript Class 5**. These exercises demonstrate working with different DOM selection methods and manipulating element styles dynamically.

## 🎯 Task 1: Dynamic Text Color Changer

### 📝 Description
A webpage featuring three paragraphs with the class name `"myPara"`. When a button is clicked, the text colors change dynamically:
- 🔵 **First paragraph** → Blue
- 🟢 **Second paragraph** → Green
- 🟡 **Third paragraph** → Yellow

### 🛠️ Method Used
**`querySelectorAll()`** - This method was chosen because:
- ✅ Returns a NodeList of all elements with the specified class
- ✅ Allows easy indexing to target specific elements
- ✅ Modern and flexible approach for multiple elements

## 🎯 Task 2: Dynamic Image Border Styler

### 📝 Description
A webpage displaying four images with the class name `"myImage"`. Upon button click, each image's border style changes:
- 📷 **First image** → Solid border
- 📷 **Second image** → Dotted border
- 📷 **Third image** → Dashed border
- 📷 **Fourth image** → Double border

### 🛠️ Method Used
**`querySelectorAll()`** - Selected for the same reasons as Task 1:
- ✅ Efficiently selects all elements with the same class
- ✅ Provides array-like access for individual styling
- ✅ Clean and maintainable code structure
